This repository was created for the Introduction to Brain Computer Interfaces course. The data located in this repository is open source data from the article listed below. The code presented here is an adaption from the open access code provided by the research group. The followiong changes were made to the original code:
Altered original preprocessing code to fix bugs, remove unnecessary lines of code, and eliminate unwanted plotting functions  
Moved from single file to multi-file function based codes for easy debugging and setup
Created a 'requirements.txt' file for easy implementation
Implemented code for making predictions, both post-hoc and for real-time analysis
